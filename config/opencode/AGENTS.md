- ALWAYS use `bun` instead of `npm` or `yarn`
- Use `bun install` for installing dependencies
- Use `bun run` for running scripts
- Use `bun add` for adding packages
- Use `bun remove` for removing packages

For Python projects:

- ALWAYS use `uv` instead of `pip`
- Use `uv pip install` for installing packages
- Use `uv pip sync` for syncing requirements
- Use `uv venv` for creating virtual environments

## Code Style

- NEVER add comments to code unless explicitly requested
- NEVER use emojis in code
- Write clean, self-documenting code
- Let the code speak for itself

## Communication Style

- NEVER use emojis in responses or messages
- Keep responses clear and concise
- Focus on technical accuracy

## Searching

- NEVER use `glob` tool for searching files or code
- Use `grep` tool for searching file contents
- Use `Task` tool with explore agent for codebase exploration
- For finding specific files, use `grep` with file patterns
